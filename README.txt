3D platformer/adventure with Japanese folklore for theme in a poetic atmosphere. Play Koda, a tanuki (to not mistake with a raccoon) who is the Kiyomori's forest Guardian. The forest is split in several areas with different environment, which are protected by divine entities.
After a terrible event, Kiyomori is corrupted and infested by Yokais, some evil spirits !
Koda will have to use his capacity and powers to resolve different encountered challenges. He will also have to fight/absorb Yokais and free the entities to purify the forest.
